# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Structure 


## &#x1F34D; Goal of the assignment 
Give travel directions in the map by using Dynamic Programming to save partial solutions that are the same and Divide and Conquer to find the fastest path at several levels of abstraction. In the end we use Dijkstra Algorithm to find the fastest path efficiency. 


## :star2: About the Project
- Algorithms needed: Devide & Conquer / Breadth First Search
- The assignment is a route planner for a fictional place (cities connected by highways)
- path -> contains a source and destination, and unambigously describe how to go from the source to the destination.
