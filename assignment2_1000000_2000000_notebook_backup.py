        This method gives a shortest route through the grid from source to destination.
        You start at the source and the algorithm ends if you reach the destination, both coordinates should be included in the path.
        To find the shortest route a version of a flood fill algorithm is used, see the explanation above.
        A route consists of a list of coordinates.

        Hint: The history is already given as a dictionary with as keys the coordinates in the state-space graph and
        as values the previous coordinate from which this coordinate was visited.

        For example: The distance between coordinates (0,0) and (0,1) is 1 and
